# Gardien_Virtuel



This program is designed to notify when a newly followed streamer goes live on Twitch or ends their stream.


This is not officially affiliated with Gardien Virtuel.

Make sure config.ini is properly configured.


This project is not finished, but the main functionality works.
I am working on a user interface, not finished.




## To compile ##

python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --name="Gardien Virtuel" main.py
